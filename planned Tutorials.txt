1. perceptron
make it predict (numbers?)
- take from DLNN book examples


2. Car detection:
Fully connected network
CNN (single layer)
Batch normalization
Dropout
ReLu
Data augmentation


3. People detection:
- new data rec. by Mon Style
CNN (single + two layer)
VGG
train/test split
cross-validation

show learned filters


4. Music vs. Speech (GTZAN)
or 
Music
or 
Urban Audio
or
Domestic Audio (multi-label)

-> showcase parallel CNN

5.
RNN example?

how to use pre-trained model
